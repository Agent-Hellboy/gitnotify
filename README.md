ü§ñ Welcome to the AI-Powered Development Revolution! üöÄ

This repository is my experiment in "Zero-Brain Development" - where I'm letting AI do the heavy lifting while I sit back with popcorn üçø. Using the power of AI, we're building a modern SaaS application with Django and React, and I'm just here to watch the magic happen.

üß™ The Experiment:
- Going full AI mode: My brain is on vacation while AI does the coding
- Time Tracking: Documenting how fast AI can build a production-ready app
- Tracking When i need to push AI and When i don't need to push AI

üí° Think of it as "Inception" but for coding - it's AI all the way down!
